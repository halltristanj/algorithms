# algorithms
Algorithms from different projects.

Either it is created here or it is created in a different project than copied here,
these are different algorithms I've written by myself (of course after learning about them). 
If based on another person's work, I cite them in the code.

Doubling this at times for a CI/CD test pipeline. That's why there's way more in this than there needs to be.
