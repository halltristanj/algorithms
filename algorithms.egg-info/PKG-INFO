Description: # algorithms
        Algorithms from different projects.
        
        Either it is created here or it is created in a different project than copied here,
        these are different algorithms I've written by myself (of course after learning about them). 
        If based on another person's work, I cite them in the code.
        
        Doubling this at times for a CI/CD test pipeline. That's why there's way more in this than there needs to be.
